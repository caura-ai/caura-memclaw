"""M-61 — the crystallizer's dedup sweep must not see the rows it archived.

Against real Postgres, because the finding is entirely about which rows two SQL
predicates reach. Stubs would assert the code calls itself.

The loop this closes: run 1 merges cluster {S1,S2,S3} into crystal F and archives
the sources. F is >=0.95 similar to them — that is what made them a cluster — and
F is written with ``last_dedup_checked_at`` NULL, so run 2 picks F as a candidate,
finds the ARCHIVED S1/S2 as neighbours, re-forms {F,S1,S2}, re-sends it to the
LLM, and then archives F, because the archive step takes every cluster member.

A pair is (candidate, neighbour), so both queries need the filter: an archived row
excluded from one end still reaches a cluster through the other. There is a test
for each end.
