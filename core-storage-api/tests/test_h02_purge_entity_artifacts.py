"""H-02 — removing the graph rows mined out of a governance-dropped memory.

Against real Postgres, because the thing under test is a three-statement delete
whose correctness is entirely about what it does and does NOT reach. A stub
would assert the code calls itself.

The schema already says these rows must not outlive the memory:
``memory_entity_links.memory_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` and
``relations.evidence_memory_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL``. Both fire on a HARD
delete only. Governance soft-deletes, so neither ever fires — and the entity
names mined from dropped content stay listable tenant-wide.

The negative cases carry the weight here. This deletes rows, so a query that
reaches one row too far is worse than the leak it closes.
