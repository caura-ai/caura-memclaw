# caura-client

> Formerly `memclaw-client`. The old `memclaw-client` PyPI package, the `memclaw_client` import, and the in-package `MemClaw`/`MemClawError`/`MemClawAPIError` class aliases were all retired; no transition is owed to pre-rename installs. <!-- legacy-name-ok: taught as legacy alias -->

Official Python client for [Caura](https://caura.ai) — governed shared
memory for AI agent fleets (multi-agent, multi-tenant, MCP-native).

A thin wrapper over the Caura REST API. Point it at a managed
(`https://caura.ai`) or self-hosted (`http://localhost:8000`) deployment.

## Install

```bash
pip install caura-client
```

## Quickstart

```python
from caura_client import Caura

# Recommended: the client is a context manager and closes its HTTP
# connection on exit (use close() for manual management).
with Caura("mc_xxx", tenant_id="my-team", agent_id="my-agent") as mc:
    # Write a memory — enriched server-side with type, title, tags, importance.
    mc.write("Q3 revenue target is $4M, set on 2026-04-15.")

    # Search (ranked raw results)
    for m in mc.search("Q3 revenue target", top_k=5):
        print(m.title, "—", m.content)

    # Recall (LLM-synthesized context brief)
    print(mc.recall("Q3 revenue target").summary)
```

Self-hosted? Pass `base_url`:

```python
with Caura("standalone", tenant_id="default", base_url="http://localhost:8000") as mc:
    ...
```

## Retrying transient read failures

Retries are disabled by default. Set `retries` to the number of additional
attempts and `retry_backoff` to the initial delay in seconds:

```python
with Caura("mc_xxx", tenant_id="my-team", retries=2, retry_backoff=0.5) as mc:
    memories = mc.search("Q3 revenue target")
```

Only `search`, `recall`, `health`, and `get_document` retry. `write` and
`submit_interview` never retry, even when retries are enabled, because an
ambiguous failure could otherwise duplicate a write. Reads retry HTTP transport
errors and statuses 429, 502, 503, and 504. Other responses retain the existing
error mapping immediately. After exhaustion, the final error is propagated.

Delays double between retries. A valid numeric or HTTP-date `Retry-After`
header can extend the delay; invalid values fall back to the backoff.
`timeout` still applies per request, so the total call can take longer when
retries are enabled. These synchronous delays block the calling thread.


## API

| Method | Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `write(content, ...)` | `POST /api/v1/memories` | `Memory` |
| `search(query, top_k=5, ...)` | `POST /api/v1/search` | `list[Memory]` |
| `recall(query, top_k=5, ...)` | `POST /api/v1/recall` | `RecallResult` |
| `health()` | `GET /api/v1/health` | `dict` |
| `get_document(doc_id, *, collection, ...)` | `GET /api/v1/documents/{doc_id}` | `dict` |
| `submit_interview(...)` | `POST /api/v1/interview/submit` | `dict` |
| `close()` | — | `None` |

The client is a context manager (`with Caura(...) as mc:`) and raises
`AuthError` (401/403), `NotFoundError` (404), or `CauraAPIError` on failures.
Every result also exposes the full API payload on `.raw`.

### Unknown fields on writes are rejected

`write()` forwards any extra keyword arguments straight into the request body
(`mc.write("...", some_field=1)`). The API rejects a field it does not declare
with **422** and names it:

```python
try:
    mc.write("a memory", tags=["alpha"])   # `tags` is not a write field
except CauraAPIError as exc:
    exc.payload["error"]["details"]["unknown_fields"]   # ["tags"]
```

This used to return `201` with the field silently discarded, so an integration
that "worked" may start failing here — the data it sent was never being stored.
Caller-owned keys belong under `metadata` (`mc.write("...", metadata={"tags": [...]})`).

`search()` and `recall()` are unaffected: filter bodies still accept unknown
fields, deliberately. See
[api-surfaces.md](https://github.com/caura-ai/caura/blob/main/docs/api-surfaces.md#request-body-contract-writes-are-strict-searches-are-not).

### Fetching a document

`get_document()` returns the full `DocOut` envelope — the stored record is
nested under the `"data"` key, not returned directly. `collection` is a
required keyword-only argument, and a missing document raises
`NotFoundError`:

```python
with Caura("mc_xxx", tenant_id="my-team", agent_id="my-agent") as mc:
    doc = mc.get_document("doc-123", collection="interviews")
    record = doc["data"]       # the stored record lives under "data"
```

### Lifecycle

`Caura` holds an `httpx.Client`, so prefer the `with` form above — the
connection is closed on exit. For manual management, call `close()`
explicitly when you are done:

```python
mc = Caura("mc_xxx", tenant_id="my-team", agent_id="my-agent")
try:
    mc.write("...")
finally:
    mc.close()
```

### `submit_interview()` is an Interviewer-internal surface

`submit_interview()` is used by the `caura-interviewer` adapter below to
submit parsed session windows to the server. It is not intended as a
general-purpose SDK method: it calls the server synchronously (the server
interviews the window in-line, up to a 90s budget), so its `timeout`
defaults to 120s rather than the client-wide 30s, and the returned body
carries an extra `"http_status"` key so callers can tell a `207` partial
from a `200` committed. New SDK users should not need it.

For credentials, scopes, and the full API surface, see the
[Caura docs](https://caura.ai/docs). Production fleets should use
[per-agent keys](https://caura.ai/docs/integrations/per-agent-keys).

## caura-interviewer — Claude Code + Cursor adapter

Installing this package also provides the `caura-interviewer` CLI (the
legacy `memclaw-interviewer` entrypoint is installed too and keeps working): the <!-- legacy-name-ok: taught as legacy alias -->
Caura Interviewer's disk-parser adapter for Claude Code and Cursor
workstations. It reads agent session transcripts **read-only** — Claude
Code's `~/.claude/projects/…/*.jsonl` or Cursor's
`~/.cursor/projects/…/agent-transcripts/…/*.jsonl` — tracks a per-file
cursor via the server's forward-only watermark documents (no local state),
and submits event windows to `POST /api/v1/interview/submit`, where Caura
synthesizes them into typed memories. Requires the tenant to have
`interviewer.enabled = true`.

```bash
export CAURA_API_KEY=mc_xxx CAURA_TENANT_ID=my-team
export CAURA_INTERVIEWER_PROJECTS="-Users-me-work-*"     # allowlist, default-deny

caura-interviewer status --since-hours 24       # cursors vs. local line counts
caura-interviewer run --dry-run -v              # parse + window, submit nothing
caura-interviewer run --max-windows 8           # submit due windows
caura-interviewer run --harness cursor          # harvest Cursor instead (or
                                                # CAURA_INTERVIEWER_HARNESS=cursor)
```

Every `CAURA_*` variable above also answers to its pre-rename `MEMCLAW_*` name; where both are set the first non-empty value wins. <!-- legacy-name-ok: taught as legacy alias -->

**Privacy:** default-deny — with no allowlist the CLI lists discovered
project dirs and exits with guidance; `--all-projects` is the explicit
opt-in. Credential-shaped strings are scrubbed locally before anything
leaves the machine, and the server masks PII again on receipt.

**Triggers:** run it from cron, or wire the harness's session-end hook so a
session is interviewed the moment it ends (a failed harvest never fails
the session — the hook always exits 0). The SAME hook command serves both
harnesses: each sends `transcript_path` on stdin, and the harness is
inferred from the path shape.

Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{ "hooks": { "SessionEnd": [ { "hooks": [
  { "type": "command", "command": "caura-interviewer hook", "timeout": 300 }
] } ] } }
```

Cursor (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`):
```json
{ "version": 1, "hooks": {
  "sessionEnd": [ { "command": "caura-interviewer hook" } ]
} }
```

**Schedule the cron in one command.** Rather than hand-editing crontab,
`install` writes an idempotent cron entry (and a `0600` env file it sources,
since cron doesn't inherit your shell environment). Config comes from the
same flags/env as `run`:
```bash
caura-interviewer install --interval 30m          # add --harness cursor for Cursor
caura-interviewer uninstall                        # removes the entry + env file
```
It refuses to schedule a job that would no-op (missing credentials or no
project allowlist). On Windows (no `crontab`), use Task Scheduler to run
`caura-interviewer run` on a timer instead.

Crash-safety is inherited from the Interviewer protocol: the watermark
advances only after the server commits a window, and retries of the same
window dedup server-side via a deterministic attempt id — never a gap,
never a duplicate.
