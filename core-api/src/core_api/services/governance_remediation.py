"""Fast-mode post-write governance remediation.

In fast mode (the default) enrichment is deferred to core-worker, which PATCHes
the LLM's ``contains_pii`` / ``business_relevance`` onto the already-persisted
row. The ``caura.memory.enriched`` consumer then calls
:func:`remediate_after_enrichment` to apply the tenant's configured action on
that free-form signal — the fast-mode counterpart to the synchronous
``GovernanceDecision`` step (strong mode).

The DETERMINISTIC pattern gate already ran synchronously pre-write
(``GovernanceScanContent``), so regex/Luhn/entropy-detectable PII/PCI/secrets
were never persisted in either mode; only the LLM's free-form judgement is
eventually-consistent here (≈ enrichment-deferral latency).

    Contained PER CHILD, then raised once at the end. The parent is ALREADY
    deleted by the time this runs, so letting the first failure abort the loop
    would leave every later child live with the parent gone — this feature's own
    leak, reintroduced by its error handling. One bad row must cost one row.

    NOTHING RETRIES A FAILED CHILD, and this docstring used to say the opposite.
    The retry it described was real while the raise reached the Pub/Sub
    dispatcher and redelivered the event. It stopped being real when
    ``handle_memory_enriched`` began catching ``GovernanceCascadeError`` and
    acking — which it does because redelivery re-ran the parent's entire drop
    branch and wrote another ``critical=True`` audit for an already-dropped
    memory, on every delivery, without bound. The mechanism went; the paragraph
    describing it did not, until this change. The parent's own remediation has
    already succeeded by now, so no later event revisits this row either.

    Recovery is therefore a person, working from the ERROR logs below, and they
    are written to make that possible rather than merely to record that
    something failed. The audit and the delete are attempted in SEPARATE
    ``try`` blocks so a reader can tell the two states apart:

    * ``audit_emitted=False`` — nothing happened to the row. It is live and the
      compliance log does not claim otherwise.
    * ``audit_emitted=True`` — the one that needs hands. The log RECORDS the row
      as removed and the row is still live.

    The audit still precedes the delete, and that ordering is what makes the
    second state possible — deliberately, because the alternative is worse. A
    false "dropped" entry is discoverable and the content is still there to
    remove; auditing afterwards would turn the same failure into a deletion
    with no record of it at all.

    H-02. #808 established that a drop must stop the derived rows too, and
    named this case explicitly — "entities mined out of dropped content are the
    same leak in another table". It fixed the INLINE path, by ordering:
    ``_enrich_memory_background`` runs remediation first and its early return
    skips the entity extraction scheduled below it.

    Both non-inline paths schedule extraction independently, at write time, as
    a task that races the verdict — and extraction is one LLM call while the
    verdict needs enrichment plus an event round-trip, so extraction usually
    wins. ``process_entity_extraction`` never re-checked the row, and a
    soft-deleted memory still satisfies the link and relation foreign keys. So
    the names survived, listable tenant-wide through ``/entities`` and
    ``/graph``, with nothing tying them to the drop.

    Not guarded by a marker, unlike the child cascade: any dropped memory may
    have been extracted from, there is no flag on the row saying so, and the
    purge is three targeted deletes keyed on ``memory_id`` — cheap enough to
    run unconditionally rather than gate on something that could drift.

    Failures are LOGGED, not raised, and that is the opposite of what the rest
    of this module does — so it needs its reason stated.

    An earlier draft let this propagate "matching every other unapplied-policy
    path in this module". That was wrong about the caller. The other paths run
    under ``_enrich_memory_background``, where a raise becomes a
    ``BackgroundTaskLog`` row. This one also runs under
    ``consumer.handle_memory_enriched``, which has no guard around it, and the
    Pub/Sub dispatcher NACKS on a handler exception — a documented, load-bearing
    invariant. So a raise here redelivers the same event, re-runs the whole drop
    branch, and emits a SECOND ``critical=True`` audit for a memory that was
    already dropped. Repeatedly. Duplicate destructive entries in a
    tamper-evident log, for a row nothing further can be done to.

    The trade the other way is bounded: the memory itself is already gone, so
    the content is not live. What remains is graph rows, and an ERROR naming the
    memory is enough to purge them by hand. A transient failure does not even
    reach here — ``purge_entity_artifacts`` is marked idempotent, so the client
