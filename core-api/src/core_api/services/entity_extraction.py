    Deliberately NOT ``common.llm.providers.ProviderResponseShapeError``, which

    parsed_type)`` and it STORES and renders ``content`` (1 KiB) in ``__str__``.
    Passing this payload through it would put memory content, and any PII in
    it, into every traceback that error reaches. This condition is a domain

EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """\
Extract named entities, their relations, and surface-form mentions from the following memory content.

Rules:
- canonical_name: lowercase, no articles (the, a, an)
- entity_type: one of person, organization, technology, project, concept, location, event, identifier, artifact, role
- role: one of subject, object, mentioned
- The SUBJECT is the entity the statement is ABOUT — the grammatical subject of
  the main clause. The VALUE being asserted about it is the object, even when
  that value is itself a named person, place or quantity. Choose the subject the
  same way every time: it does not change because the value changed.
    "The billing service owner is Dana."   -> subject: billing service owner
                                              object:  dana
    "The deploy window is 03:00 UTC."      -> subject: deploy window
                                              object:  03:00 utc
  Marking "dana" the subject there would make an UPDATE to that fact look like a
  statement about a different subject, and the update would never supersede the
  value it replaces. Exactly one entity carries role=subject unless the content
  genuinely asserts facts about two independent subjects.
- relation_type: short verb phrase like works_on, uses, belongs_to, created_by, depends_on, manages, located_in
- Extract every distinct named subject. Include identifiers (PR-2025-A, build-734), product codes (Vermillion-7), model names (gpt-5.4-nano), and version strings as entity_type=identifier or entity_type=artifact when they refer to a specific named thing.
- Job titles (ceo, engineer, manager, director, officer) classify as entity_type=role — NOT person. Use entity_type=person only when a named individual is referenced (e.g., "Anna Bergstrom"). "the CEO" alone is a role; "Anna, the CEO" is one person entity plus one role entity.
- mentions: list every surface form referring to an entity in the content, including pronouns. Assign coreferring mentions the same cluster_id integer (0, 1, 2, ...) — cluster_id is never null. Set entity_canonical to the referenced entity, or null if unresolved.
- If no entities found, return empty lists

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema (no markdown fences):
{{
  "entities": [{{"canonical_name": "...", "entity_type": "...", "role": "..."}}],
  "relations": [{{"from_entity": "...", "relation_type": "...", "to_entity": "..."}}],

    a null ``cluster_id`` on mention 10 of 15 took out the entire extraction in
    prod on 2026-08-16 (#788), and every remaining non-optional field here —
    ``canonical_name``, ``entity_type``, ``role``, ``from_entity``,
    ``relation_type``, ``to_entity``, ``surface`` — carries the identical
    exposure. Fixing them one nullable field at a time is whack-a-mole; the
    parse boundary is where the blast radius is set.

    Mirrors the ``atomic_facts`` loop in
    ``common/enrichment/service.py::_validate_enrichment``, which walks that
    provider output item-by-item and ``continue``s past entries it cannot use.
    That function's outer ``EnrichmentResult(**raw)`` used to be atomic and so
    carried this same exposure one level up; its two unguarded fields now have
    model-level ``mode="before"`` validators, so both layers are covered.

    A relation whose endpoint entity was dropped is not a dangling reference —
    ``entity_extraction_worker`` only writes an edge when both ids resolve, the
    same cascade it already documents for blocklisted nodes.

    Returns the graph plus a per-field count of what was dropped. The caller
    owns the logging so this stays a pure function.
