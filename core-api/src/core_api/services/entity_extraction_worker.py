    """Undo our own graph writes when the memory died while we were making them.

    Reports WHAT IT FOUND and leaves the policy to the caller, because the two
    call sites want different things from the same answer. An earlier revision
    returned a bool meaning "you must stop", which forced the indeterminate case
    to pick one of the two real answers and pretend — it chose "stop", and that
    silently discarded the audit-log entry, the contradiction trigger and
    cross-link discovery for a memory that a transient read timeout had said
    nothing bad about. Three states, named:

    ``dropped``
        The row is gone or soft-deleted, and its graph rows have been purged
        (or the purge failed, loudly — either way it is not coming back).
    ``live``
        The row is there. Nothing was purged and nothing should stop.
    ``unknown``
        The read itself failed. Nothing is known and nothing was purged.

    Purging is only half of the job at the first call site: everything after the
    link upsert — relation upserts carrying ``evidence_memory_id``, the subject
    write-back, cross-link discovery — writes MORE graph rows for this memory. A
    version that purged and fell through cleaned the table and then immediately
    refilled it, moving the leak from the link table to the relation table rather
    than closing it.

    H-02. The liveness check before the persistence block narrows the window; it
    cannot close it. Between that check and the links landing there are embedding
    round-trips and three storage calls, and a governance drop can complete
    inside them — including its own purge, which finds nothing because these rows
    do not exist yet. The entities then land moments later and nothing ever
    revisits them: the memory is gone, so no verdict names it again.

    Re-checking AFTER the writes closes it, and the argument is about what is
    observable rather than about timing:

    * the drop committed before our writes — its purge found nothing, but this
      check sees the row deleted, and we purge what we just wrote,
    * the drop commits after our writes — its own purge sees our rows and takes
      them,
    * the drop commits between the two — whichever purge runs later sees the
      rows, and both are keyed on the same ``memory_id``.

    That argument only holds for rows written BEFORE the call, which is why
    ``process_entity_extraction`` calls this THREE times rather than once. An
    earlier revision called it once, after the link upsert, and claimed "there is
    no ordering left in which the rows survive" — untrue of everything written
    afterwards: the subject write-back, the relation upserts, the links
    cross-link discovery creates. The call sites, and what each is for:

    * after the link upsert — an optimisation. It saves the relation upserts and
      a cross-link pass when the row is already gone, and is allowed to fall
      through on anything short of ``dropped``.
    * at the end of the ``try`` — the guarantee for the path that completes. It
      sits after every graph-mutating write, so the rows it can find are all of
      them.
    * in the ``except`` — the same guarantee for the path that leaves by
      raising, which the previous one cannot reach.

    Both of the trailing two are guarded on ``wrote_graph_rows``, so a run that
    wrote nothing does not pay for a read, and the ``except`` one also runs on
    failures early enough that ``sc`` does not exist yet.

    The WRITER read is load-bearing at every site for the same reason as the
    pre-write check: the whole question is whether a delete that just committed
    is visible.

    A failed PURGE still reports ``dropped``: the memory is gone whether or not
    the cleanup worked, and the caller's decision does not change. Only a failed
    READ is ``unknown``.
