"""Tests for fast-mode post-write governance remediation (eToro).

The fast-mode counterpart to ``GovernanceDecision``: in the default fast mode
enrichment is deferred to the worker, which PATCHes the LLM's ``contains_pii`` /
``business_relevance`` onto the already-persisted row; the enriched-event
consumer then calls ``remediate_after_enrichment`` to apply the tenant's
configured action on that free-form signal. Storage + audit are stubbed so
these stay deterministic (no async audit queue / storage round-trip).
