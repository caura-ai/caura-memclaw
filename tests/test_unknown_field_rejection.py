"""SAFE-01 — unknown fields on WRITE bodies are rejected, not dropped.

The defect: every request model inherited pydantic's default
``extra="ignore"``, so a field the model didn't declare was discarded without
a word. A caller who typed ``"contnet"`` instead of ``"content"``, or who sent
a plausible-but-unsupported key like ``"tags"``, got ``201 Created`` back and
a stored row missing the data they sent. The write "succeeded" and the payload
was gone.

Three things are pinned here, and the third matters as much as the first two:

1.  A bogus field on a write body → 422 that NAMES the field. One test per
    major write endpoint, because the fix is per-model and a model that got
    missed would otherwise still silently drop.
2.  Every legitimate spelling still works — including the ``AliasChoices``
    spellings on the search surface, which is the C1+C2 trap this repo has
    already been bitten by once (see ``schemas.SearchRequest``). Declared
    aliases are not "extra" fields, so ``forbid`` cannot break them; these
    tests are what makes that a checked fact rather than a claim.
3.  Search/filter/query bodies still ACCEPT unknown fields. That asymmetry is
    a deliberate product decision, not an oversight the fix didn't reach —
    so it gets a test that fails if someone later "finishes the job" and
    makes the search models strict too.
