"""Rename step 2: bind both names, publish exactly one.

A Pub/Sub topic cannot be renamed — it is created and deleted, and a
subscription cannot move between topics — so the cutover is expand, migrate,
contract. Step 2 is the migrate half's precondition: every subscriber holds the
old name *and* its twin, while publishing is untouched. That combination is what
makes flipping a publisher later a lossless operation instead of a gap.

Two properties carry the whole step, and both are asserted here rather than
described:

* **Publishing moves one family at a time.** ``lifecycle`` flipped on
  2026-08-28 and ``memory`` on 2026-09-01; every other family still targets the
  name it targeted before. The per-family assertions below are what stop a
  further family riding along in a diff that looks like it only touched one
  line — each flip has to restate the set, which is the point.
* **Never dual-publish.** One publish call produces exactly one message. The
  alternative cutover — publish to both names for a while — delivers every event
  twice to every subscriber bound to both, which is the failure the ordering
  exists to avoid.

The rest is about which way each default points, because the two backends need
opposite ones and a missing twin fails differently in each.

EVERY FLIPPED FAMILY IS NOW CONTRACTED, WHICH CHANGES WHAT THESE TESTS CAN USE.
``lifecycle`` and ``memory`` both stay in ``FLIPPED_FAMILIES`` while carrying the
current names, so ``renamed`` is the identity for them and a default-constructed
bus is legal again. That also means the silent-failure state this file exists to
pin can no longer be reached through any real declaration: a test that reaches
for a real family to demonstrate it goes VACUOUS. Those tests use ``PRE_CONTRACT``
instead. Tests about *the flag's parse rule* still take the ``nothing_flipped``
fixture so their precondition cannot depend on cutover state.
