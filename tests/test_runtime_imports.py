"""Fail fast if a "remove unused deps" cleanup breaks a real import.

The 2026-04-16 dep cleanup deleted `cachetools` while `tenant_settings`
still imported `TTLCache` from it — the core-api wouldn't even boot.
The regression was only caught during E2E. These tests exercise the
modules with load-time side-effects so missing transitive deps fail a
~1-second unit test instead of a container boot.
