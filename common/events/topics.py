# ── Brand rename: one publish name, a set of subscribe names ────────────────
#
# A Pub/Sub topic cannot be renamed. It is created and deleted, and a
# subscription cannot move between topics, so the cutover is expand -> migrate
# -> contract: create twin topics, have every subscriber bind both names, flip
# the publishers one family at a time, drain the old subscriptions, then delete
# them.
#
# What that needs from this module is a distinction it did not previously have
# to make, because one name served both roles:
#
#   * the PUBLISH name — exactly one, always. Publishing an event under both
#     names at once delivers it twice to every subscriber bound to both, which
#     is the precise failure the ordering above exists to avoid. There is
#     deliberately no function here that returns more than one publish name, so
#     "just publish to both for a while" is not something this API can express.
#   * the SUBSCRIBE set — one name or two. A subscriber holding both is what
#     makes flipping a publisher lossless: the message lands on whichever name
#     the publisher used, and a handler is already waiting on it.
#
# The enum members above are deliberately untouched. They still ARE their
# string values, so equality, dict-key hashing, f-string formatting and
# ``topic_path`` building all keep working exactly as the module docstring
# promises. Everything below is derived from them.

#
# THIS SET IS NOT THE SAME IN BOTH REPOS, and mirroring the enterprise line
# here would break this one. ``fleet`` and ``security`` are declared only in
# enterprise, so naming either here makes ``_validate_flipped_families`` raise
# at import in every OSS service. Rule 6 couples the two repos for a SHARED
# family — which ``lifecycle`` is — and inverts for an enterprise-only one.
#
# ``lifecycle`` flipped 2026-08-28 — the third family in this programme and the
# first SHARED one, so it lands in both repos in one cycle. Chosen over
# ``memory``, the other remaining shared family, on provisioning completeness
# rather than size: every one of the 9 topics this family declares is live in
# both environments, whereas ``memory`` then declared one topic (``.created``)
# that existed in neither. That is the same defect that disqualifies
# ``pipeline``, and a flip is not the step at which to rely on a topic being
# harmless because nothing publishes it. That declaration has since been
# removed — see the ``memory`` note below. Evidence, measured against the
# running world rather than the source tree:
#
#   * 12/12 pubsub-backed deployables reported EVENT_BUS_DUAL_SUBSCRIBE on at
#     their RUNNING revision (``check_flip_readiness.py``, enterprise).
#   * 36/36 legacy durable subscriptions across prod and staging (18 each) had
#     a twin, each verified attached to the matching twin TOPIC and not merely
#     present by name.
#   * ``preflight_dual_subscribe.py`` exited 0 for both environments, with the
#     topic-IAM half reachable, so the attach pairing was verified live and not
#     merely in config.
#   * This family has NO broadcast topic and no per-process ephemeral
#     subscription in either environment, so there is no runtime-created
#     binding to infer — every subscription it relies on is a durable resource
#     that was listed.
#
# WHAT THAT DOES NOT PROVE. Both gates read CONFIGURATION. Neither observes a
# message being delivered. A green gate is a necessary condition, never
# evidence the flip works; the end-to-end signal is the staging deploy's
# control-plane check. Do not report a green gate as a working flip.
#
# ``memory`` flipped 2026-09-01 — the fourth programme family and second
# SHARED one. This set is authored here and manually mirrored into enterprise;
# the copies are deliberately not generated or synced. Immediately before the
# edit, the live remeasurement found 12/12 running deployables dual-on and
# 16/16 active twin durables (8/environment) attached to their matching twin
# topics, with no ephemerals. The gates still read configuration only: green is
# necessary, not delivery proof. Its former blocker is cleared: the unused
# ``.created`` declaration was removed rather than provisioned.
#
# ``memory`` CONTRACTED 2026-09-05: the ``Memory`` members now carry the current
# names, so ``renamed`` is the identity for them and ``subscribe_names`` returns
# one name instead of two. Contracting it also repaired ``dual_subscribe=False``,
# which is the DEFAULT: memory was the last family flipped but not contracted, so
# until this ``unbound_publish_topics(dual=False)`` reported all four of its
# topics and the bus refused to construct at all for every standalone and on-prem
# process. It stays in the set below — see ``publish_name``, where membership is
# a no-op once ``renamed`` is the identity — and comes out with the final sweep,
# after the legacy topics are deleted.
#
# ``pipeline`` must NOT enter this set while it has zero live topics in either
# environment: publishing to a topic that does not exist is silent loss, so
# flipping it would move nothing and report success. ``org`` is shared AND its
# staging ephemeral pool was under investigation as a suspected subscription
# leak. ``audit`` LAST, unconditionally — those rows are hash-chained, and a
# lost or reordered audit event is the one failure here that replay cannot
